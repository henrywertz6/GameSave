# GameSave

GameSave is an iOS app that serves as a social video game logging platform, similar to Letterboxd for movies or GoodReads for books. Built with SwiftUI, GameSave allows users to track, rate, and share their gaming experiences.

This was a version of GameSave that was developed as my semester of Independent Work at Princeton. At the time, I had no plans on releasing the app so this repository was public. For security reasons, the current version of GameSave is not public and looks quite different from what you may see here. I plan on publishing GameSave on the App Store in the near future!
